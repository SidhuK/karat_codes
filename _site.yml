  I am Karat (Karatatiwant Singh) Sidhu. I work in the field of multi-omics, 
  specifically, metabolomics and proteomics. My primary research involves the development 
  of workflows for analysis and quantification of sophisticated biological samples for 
  metabolomic and proteomic analysis, including the use of stable isotopes for development 
  and analysis of such assays. Over the last 7 years I have been working a wide range of 
  mass spec equipment including the high resolution Q-ToFs as well as triple quadrupoles, 
  coupled with various liquid chromatography setups such as micro- and nano- LCs.
